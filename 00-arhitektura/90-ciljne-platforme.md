## Browser games

The fourth major “platform” for game development is browser or downloadable games. This is not a true hardware platform like the other three categories we have seen, but it’s so different that it makes sense to think of it as a separate platform. These are often small games, with 2D graphics and simple gameplay. They run on the user’s Web browser and are downloaded “on the fly” every time they’re played.

These games have to keep their size to a minimum to be downloaded quickly. This is particularly important to attract casual gamers who prefer not to wait around for a large download. These games are also different from regular PC games in that they do not try to take over most of the PC’s resources. Instead, they try to play nice with the rest of the applications, and are often confined to running in a window instead of taking over the full screen.

Browser games aim to be able to run in any browser, independent of the hardware or the operating system. Some of the popular languages for these games were Java and Macromedia Flash, but they need a specific browser plug-in to be installed. These languages can’t compete with C++ in terms of performance, but they allow games to be developed at a higher level of abstraction. The emphasis of these games is on gameplay, not technical innovation.
