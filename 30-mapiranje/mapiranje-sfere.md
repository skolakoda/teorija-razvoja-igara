# Mapiranje zemlje

We have a destination bitmap and the source bitmap. If the source bitmap were a map of the earth, we would make a sphere that looks exactly like the earth seen from space. In between we have to do some transformation and there is where the sine and cosine come in to play.

We go through all pixels of the destination bitmap and try to figure out which pixel of the source bitmap should go there. What we need here is a basic formula that gives us the coordinates (p, q) on the source bitmap given the coordinates (x, y) on the destination bitmap.

## Mapiranje cilindra (Cylindrical mapping)

Let's make it a bit simpler. Let's start with a cylinder instead of a sphere. We are going to make a cylinder in the way we did it in kindergarten. We take a nice flat piece of paper (the source bitmap) and roll it up. The bitmap wraps around so that the topright pixel of the source bitmap is right next to the topleft pixel.

Suppose we wanted to go from source to destination. We want to know for each position (p, q) on the cylinder where on the screen it should go. Coordinate y is simple. It simply equals q. x is more difficult. If the angle p is 0, the x coordinate should be the center of the cylinder plus the radius. If p is 90 degrees, the x coordinate should be in the center. If p is 180, it should be the center minus the radius. The function which does exactly that is: the cosine!

```
x = center + radius * cos(p)
y = q
```

We are still missing the z coordinate here. A cylinder is a three-dimensional object so we can also calculate the z coordinate for each point.
```
z = center + radius * sin (p)
```

If we want to work from the destination out, we have to turn these formula's around, like this:
```
q = y
cos (p) = (center - x) / radius
```
odnosno:
```
p = arccos ((center - x) / radius)
```

        //q is the same throughout this line. we can calculate it already
        //y has a range from 0..h, and we have to change that into a
        //range from 0..map->h
        //so we use this expression:
        q = y * map- >h / h;

        // for each pixel in the line:
        for (x = - r; x < r; x++)
        {
        fixed temp; // a temporary variable we use for calculating p

        // right now, x is between -r and r.
        // x must be between 1 and -1 before we can use asin
        // so therefor we divide by r
        temp = itofix(x) / r;

        // now we can use the asin() function
        temp = fixasin (temp);
        // the result is an angle between -64 and 64.        

        // the next expression changes that to angle between 0..64 and 192..255,
        // which is equivalent, because 192 == -64,
        // but postive integers are a bit easier to deal with
        temp &= 0xFFFFFF;

        // the actual p has to cover the whole bitmap
        // so we go from 0..256 to 0..bmp->w
        p = fixtoi (temp) * (map->w-1) / 256;

        // now we know p and q. copy a pixel.
        putpixel (target, x + cx, top + y,
              getpixel (map, p, q)
              );
        }
    }
}

## Mapiranje sfere

How do we go from p,q to x, y. And let's not forget z this time. This time, the y coordinate should also have some sine in it, because it reaches its maximum when q is 90, and when q is over 90 it should go back again.

```
x = center + radius * cos (p)
y = center + radius * sin (q)
z = center + radius * sin (p)
```

Well this gives us some kind of 2-way cylinder. Actually we need to scale x and z down a bit:
```
x = center + radius * cos (p) * scale_factor
y = center + radius * sin (q)
z = center + radius * sin (p) * scale_factor
```

The scale factor should be 0 when q is 90 or -90, and 1 when q is 0:

```
x = center + radius * cos (p) * cos(q)
y = center + radius * sin (q)
z = center + radius * sin (p) * cos(q)
```
