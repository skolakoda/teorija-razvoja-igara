## Shield

A shield is a protective layer that prevents the user from accidentally activating a feature or function that causes undesirable side effects. For example, a button that causes the game to shut down would constitute an undesirable side effect. The shield forces the user to confirm his decision, so two mistakes are required to mistake.

## State

States are visual cues of the user's current situation. States are incredibly popular. From "lock on" indicators in a combat flight simulator to robes worn by a role-playing game character.

## Magnetism

Magnetism is a very powerful pattern when we need the user to be precise. For example, in a first-person shooter where the player needs to aim at enemies from far away in combat, it makes sense to code an auto-aim, so that if the enemy is located more or less in front of the player, it takes care of the precise aiming.

## Progress

Progress is one of the most widely used patterns. Its main application is displaying quantitative information about a process with a beginning and an end, so the user knows how long the process is and where he is currently.

The obvious example is progress bars such as the ones used to depict level loading. A good example is life meters.
