### Drvo odluka

A decision tree is a simple way of representing decision making. Each nonleaf node in the tree is called a decision node, and it represents a single decision with a binary yes/no answer. Each leaf node is called an action node, and it represents an action (a new state).

A decision is made by starting at the root node and recursively walking down the tree until an action node is reached.
