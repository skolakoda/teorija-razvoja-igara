## Mapiranje ploƒçica (Tile mapping)

Tile mapping is a compression technique that will allow us to create good-looking game worlds at a fraction of the memory footprint. Mapping was used in thousands of classic games, and is still used today. The key idea is to divide our game world into a set of tiles (basic primitives). Each tile is a rectangular pattern, which we will combine with other tiles to represent the level.

We could repeat the same pattern frequently, but we will only have it once in memory.
