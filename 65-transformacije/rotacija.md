# Rotacija

There are actually two different approaches to rotating objects. One method uses quaternions, but the math is complex. This second method is Euler rotation. It is very similar to scaling and translating.

By default, the rotation matrix rotates objects with respect to the origin, just like the scaling matrix does. The resulting effect is that the object appears to be orbiting about the origin.
