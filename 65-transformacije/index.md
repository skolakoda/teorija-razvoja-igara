# Transformacije

Transformations is really just a fancy word for moving objects around in your world. It encompasses movement such as forward and backward or up and down motion, scaling objects larger or smaller, and even rotating objects.

If you plan to scale or rotate the object, you need to use matrix multiplication. Also, take note of the order in which the matrices are multiplied.
