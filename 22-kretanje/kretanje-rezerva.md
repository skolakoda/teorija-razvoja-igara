## Kinetička energija

Kinetic energy is a form of energy associated with moving bodies. It is equal to the energy required to accelerate the body from rest, which is also equal to the energy required to bring the moving body to a stop.

## Momentum

Momentum is defined as mass times velocity.
```
p = m * v
```

Because momentum is based on velocity, which constantly changes, it makes sense to talk about instantaneous momentum at specific points in time or change in momentum over a time interval.

Trik: Add a small force vector every frame in the direction the vehicle is currently facing, to simulate momentum. It’s important that this force vector be a percentage of the speed rather than a literal value.

## Inercija

When we wish to change the speed, the body shows a certain resistance against such changes. This resistance, called inertia, is a result of the body's mass. The larger the mass of the body, the smaller the change of speed will be.
