## Proceduralne tehnike (fraktali)

Procedural textures are materials defined in mathematical functions that, when combined, produce aesthetically pleasing results. Procedural methods are resolution independent by nature. When you hard-code a texture map in Photoshop, you are essentially locking down the level of detail. The same way a fractal can have infinite detail, a procedural method can be arbitrarily detailed as well.
