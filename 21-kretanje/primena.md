The process for simulating an object’s motion goes something like this:

1. Figure out what the forces are on an object
2. Add those forces up to get a single “resultant” or “net” force
3. Use F = ma to calculate the object’s acceleration due to those forces
4. Use the object’s acceleration to calculate the object’s velocity
5. Use the object’s velocity to calculate the object’s position
6. Since the forces on the object may change from moment to moment, repeat this process, forever.

Ili:
1. Calculate the body’s mass properties (mass, center of mass, and moment of inertia).
2. Identify and quantify all forces and moments acting on the body.
3. Take the vector sum of all forces and moments.
4. Solve the equations of motion for linear and angular accelerations.
5. Integrate with respect to time to find linear and angular velocity.
6. Integrate again with respect to time to find linear and angular displacement.
