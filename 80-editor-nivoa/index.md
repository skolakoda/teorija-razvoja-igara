A game editor is primarily designed to allow the user to populate a game world with static and dynamic elements. 

## The Game World Editor

The game world editor generally permits the initial value of game object properties to be specified.

It’s important for the user of an editor to be able to visualize the contents of the game world. As such, game world editors provide a three-dimensional perspective view and/or a two-dimensional orthographic projection.

### Navigation

Clearly, a world editor wouldn’t be of much use if the user weren’t able to move around within the game world. In an orthographic view, it’s important to be able to scroll and zoom in and out.

It may be possible to focus on an individual object and rotate around it. It may also be possible to switch into a “fly through” mode where the camera rotates about its own focal point and can be moved forward, backward, up, and down and panned left and right.

### Selection

It’s important for the user to be able to select individual elements for editing.
