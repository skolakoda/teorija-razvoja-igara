## Rotacija

A fundamental difference between particles and rigid bodies is that we cannot ignore rotation of rigid bodies.

In two dimensions, it’s quite easy to express the orientation of a rigid body; you need only a single scalar to represent the body’s rotation about a single axis. In three dimensions, however, there are three primary coordinate axes about each of which a body may rotate. Moreover, a body in three dimensions may rotate about any arbitrary axis, not necessarily one of the coordinate axes.

The three Euler angles (roll, pitch, and yaw) represent the orientation of a rigid body in 3D. For example, in an airplane the nose pitches up or down, the plane rolls (or banks) left or right, and the yaw (or heading) changes to the left or right.

When the object rotates freely, it always rotates about the center of mass. Different objects rotate very differently, depending on their shape and how their weight is distributed.

### Obrtni moment (torque)

Moment sile ili obrtni moment (torque) je tendencija sile da rotira predmet oko njegove ose ili tačke oslonca. Think of a wrench. As you push on it to get a bolt loose, you apply a certain force to the end of a wrench of some length.

Torque is measured by force, specified in Newton-meters. 5 Newton-meters is a 5 Newton force applied about a 1 meter length.
