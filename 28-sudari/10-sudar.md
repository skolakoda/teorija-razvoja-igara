# Sudar (*kolizija*)

Prilikom sudara, dva tela deluju jedno na drugo. Nakon sudara, njihovo kretanje se menja.

we need to make a distinction between collision detection and collision response.

## Sistem kolizije

Any collision system should be able to do a few basic things: report collision events, perform raycasts and shapecasts, and handle phantom objects.

A collision event should give you at a very minimum the following data: the two objects that collided, the sum normal of the collision, and the force of the collision.

Sort objects into collision groups: It optimizes the entire collision system. For example, objects like a bunch of crates on the first floor canâ€™t collide with another group of crates on the second floor if they are physically separated by something like an elevator.
